### Purpose
This project should be treated as a proving ground for in-house utilities/frameworks that are generic enough to be shared across other java applications. Develop them here until they're ready to go public. In the meantime, we can put them to the test in Android apps and all Java APIs.

### What Doesn't Belong
- Database schemas
- Hardcoded utilities
- Platform dependent code

### What Does Belong
- Configurable utilities
- Platform independent framework-like things
